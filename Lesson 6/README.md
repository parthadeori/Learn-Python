# **Lesson 6: Math Functions in Python**

Welcome to Lesson 6! 🧮 In this lesson, we will explore some commonly used math functions in Python. Math functions allow us to perform various mathematical operations conveniently. Let's dive in and learn about these functions. 🚀🐍

## **Math Functions in Python**

1. `abs(x)`: The `abs()` function returns the absolute value of a number `x`. The absolute value is the positive value of `x`, irrespective of its sign. ✖️

```python
x = -5
abs_x = abs(x)
print(abs_x)  # Output: 5
```

   The `abs()` function can be useful when you want to ensure that a value is positive.

2. `round(x)`: The `round()` function rounds a number `x` to the nearest integer. If the fractional part of `x` is less than 0.5, it rounds down; otherwise, it rounds up. 🔄

```python
x = 3.7
rounded_x = round(x)
print(rounded_x)  # Output: 4
```

   The `round()` function is handy when you need to round off numbers to a specific precision.

## **Practice Exercise**

Now it's time to practice your knowledge of math functions in Python! In the `practice.py` file within this folder, you will find a set of exercises related to math functions. Your task is to write Python code to solve each problem. Remember to run your code and check the expected output.

1. Write a program that calculates the area of a circle. Prompt the user to enter the radius of the circle, and use the math.pi constant to perform the calculation.

2. Create a program that converts degrees to radians. Prompt the user to enter an angle in degrees, and use the math.radians() function to convert it to radians.

## **Next Step**
