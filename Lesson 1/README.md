# **Lesson 1: Write your First Python Program** üêç

üìÅ This folder contains the first lesson in the "Learn Python" series. In this lesson, you will learn how to write your first Python program using the `print()` function. Follow the instructions below to get started.

## **Writing Your First Python Program**

Let's write a simple Python program that uses the `print()` function to display some messages on the screen. This will help you understand how the `print()` function works and how to use it to output different types of data.

1. üìù **Open the `main.py` file** in your text editor or code editor.

2. You will see the following code into the `main.py` file:

```python
# This is a simple Python program to print "Hello, World!" on the screen.
print("Hello, World!")
```

## **Running the Python Program**

‚ñ∂Ô∏è **To run the code inside VS Code**, click on the "Run" menu at the top and choose "Run Without Debugging" or use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl + F5`. You can also run the code in a terminal by navigating to the folder and running the `python main.py` command.

```
Hello, World!
```

Congratulations! üéâ You have successfully written and executed your first Python program using the `print()` function.

<!-- ## **Code Playground**

For an interactive experience and to see the actual code in action, you can visit the code playground for this lesson: [Lesson 1 Code Playground](https://www.online-python.com/HJMK7cwdGE)

Feel free to experiment and modify the code to see how it behaves. -->

## **Practise Exercise**

Now, let's move on to the next step! Open the `practice.py` file and solve the given question.

Your task is to write the code in the `practice.py` file and run it..

üí° **Hint**: You can use the `print()` function to display the result on the screen.

Once you've solved the question, proceed to the next step to check your solution.

## **Next Steps**

Now that you have written your first Python program, you are ready to dive deeper into Python programming. Head over to "Lesson 2" to learn more about variables, data types, and basic operations in Python.

Happy coding! üöÄ
