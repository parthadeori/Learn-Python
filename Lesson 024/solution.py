# Write a Python program that creates a list called `numbers` with some numbers of your choice. Use the appropriate list methods to:

numbers = [8, 3, 5, 1, 6]

# Add 10 to the end of the list
numbers.append(10)

# Remove 5 from the list
numbers.remove(5)

# Sort the list in ascending order
numbers.sort()

# Print the final list
print(numbers)
