# Here's a practice exercise that involves using the `append()`, `insert()`, `remove()`, and `pop()` methods on a list:

# 1. Create an empty list called `fruits`.
# 2. Prompt the user to enter the names of three fruits, one at a time. Use the `append()` method to add each fruit to the `fruits` list.
# 3. Prompt the user to enter an additional fruit name. Use the `insert()` method to add this fruit at the beginning of the `fruits` list.
# 4. Print the `fruits` list.
# 5. Prompt the user to enter a fruit name to remove from the list. Use the `remove()` method to remove the specified fruit from the `fruits` list.
# 6. Print the updated `fruits` list.
# 7. Use the `pop()` method to remove and print the last fruit from the `fruits` list.
# 8. Print the final `fruits` list.
