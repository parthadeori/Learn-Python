# **Lesson 2: Printing, Inputting, and Commenting in Python**

üêç Welcome to "Lesson 2: Printing, Inputting, and Commenting in Python"! In this lesson, we'll explore various concepts related to printing output, taking user input, and adding comments to our Python code. Let's dive in!

## **Printing Output**

The `print()` function is a powerful tool for displaying information on the screen. It allow us to output text, variables, and expressions. Here's an example that demonstrates its usage:

```python
# Example: Printing Output

# Print a simple message
print("Hello, World!")

# Print a variable
name = "Alice"
print("Welcome,", name)

# Print an expression
a = 5
b = 3
print("The sum of", a, "and", b, "is", a + b)
```

In this example, we use the `print()` function to display a message, the value of a variable, and the result of an expression. Feel free to experiment with different messages and formats to customize your output.

## **Taking User Input**

Python provides the `input()` function to obtain input from the user. It allow us to prompt the user for information and store their response in a variable. Here's an example:

```python
# Example: Taking User Input

# Prompt the user for their name
name = input("Please enter your name: ")

# Display a personalized message
print("Hello,", name, "! Welcome to Python.")
```

In this example, we use the `input()` function to ask the user for their name. The user's input is then stored in the `name` variable, which we use to personalize the output message. Run the code, enter your name when prompted, and see the personalized message displayed on the screen.

## **Commenting Your Code**

Comments are essential for adding explanations and notes to our code. They are not executed by the Python interpreter and are meant for human readers. Comments help improve code readability and understanding. Here's an example:

```python
# Example: Commenting Your Code

# This is a simple program that calculates the area of a rectangle.

# Input the dimensions
length = 10   # length of the rectangle
width = 5     # width of the rectangle

# Calculate the area
area = length * width

# Output the result
print("The area of the rectangle is:", area)
```

In this example, we use comments to describe the purpose of the program and explain each step of the calculation. Comments start with the `#` symbol and continue until the end of the line.

Feel free to modify the code, try different inputs, and observe the results. -->

## **Practice Exercise**

Now, let's move on to the next step! Open the `practice.py` file and solve the given question.

Your task is to write the code in the `practice.py` file and run it..

üí° **Hint**: You can use the `input()` function to display the result on the screen.

Once you've solved the question, proceed to the next step to check your solution.

Once you've completed the exercise, run the code and verify if it produces the expected output.

üöÄ Congratulations! You've learned about printing output, taking user input, and adding comments in Python. These fundamental concepts will be the building blocks for your future programming endeavors. Keep practicing and exploring new possibilities!

## **Next Steps**

Now that you have understand about Printing, Inputting and Commenting in Python. Head over to "Lesson 3" to learn more about variables, data types, and basic operations in Python.

Happy coding! üöÄ
