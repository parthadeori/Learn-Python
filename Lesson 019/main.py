# Example: Boolean Operators
x = 10
y = 5
z = 3

# and operator
print(x > y and y > z)  # Output: True

# or operator
print(x > y or y > z)  # Output: True

# not operator
print(not x > y)  # Output: False


# Example: Comparison Operators
age = 25

# Equality operator
print(age == 25)  # Output: True

# Inequality operator
print(age != 30)  # Output: True

# Greater than operator
print(age > 20)  # Output: True

# Less than operator
print(age < 30)  # Output: True

# Greater than or equal to operator
print(age >= 25)  # Output: True

# Less than or equal to operator
print(age <= 30)  # Output: True
