# **Lesson 11: Augmented Assignment Operator**

In this lesson, we will explore the concept of the **Augmented Assignment Operator** in Python. The augmented assignment operator is a shorthand way of performing arithmetic or logical operations on variables and assigning the result back to the same variable.

## **📝 Assignment Operator vs. Augmented Assignment Operator**

Before we dive into augmented assignment, let's understand the difference between the regular assignment operator (`=`) and the augmented assignment operator (`+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`).

The regular assignment operator simply assigns a value to a variable:

```python
x = 5
```

On the other hand, the augmented assignment operator performs an operation on the variable and then assigns the result back to the same variable:

```python
x += 5  # Equivalent to: x = x + 5
```

## **🔄 Augmented Assignment Operators**

Here are some commonly used augmented assignment operators:

- `+=` : Addition assignment operator
- `-=` : Subtraction assignment operator
- `*=` : Multiplication assignment operator
- `/=` : Division assignment operator
- `%=` : Modulus assignment operator

## 🌟 **Code Examples**

Let's look at some code examples to better understand the usage of augmented assignment operators:

```python
# Addition assignment
x = 5
x += 3  # Equivalent to: x = x + 3
print(x)  # Output: 8

# Subtraction assignment
y = 10
y -= 4  # Equivalent to: y = y - 4
print(y)  # Output: 6

# Multiplication assignment
z = 2
z *= 5  # Equivalent to: z = z * 5
print(z)  # Output: 10

# Division assignment
a = 15
a /= 3  # Equivalent to: a = a / 3
print(a)  # Output: 5.0

# Modulus assignment
b = 12
b %= 5  # Equivalent to: b = b % 5
print(b)  # Output: 2
```

## 🧩 Practice Exercise

Now it's time for you to practice using augmented assignment operators. Open the `practice.py` file in this folder and solve the following exercise:

1. Create a variable `count` and initialize it with the value `10`.
2. Use the augmented assignment operator to subtract `3` from `count`.
3. Multiply `count` by `4` using the augmented assignment operator.
4. Divide `count` by `2` using the augmented assignment operator.
5. Print the final value of `count` to the console.
