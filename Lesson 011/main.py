# Regular Assignment Operator (=)
x = 5


# Augmented Assignment Operator
x += 5  # Equivalent to: x = x + 5

# Addition assignment
x = 5
x += 3  # Equivalent to: x = x + 3
print(x)  # Output: 8

# Subtraction assignment
y = 10
y -= 4  # Equivalent to: y = y - 4
print(y)  # Output: 6

# Multiplication assignment
z = 2
z *= 5  # Equivalent to: z = z * 5
print(z)  # Output: 10

# Division assignment
a = 15
a /= 3  # Equivalent to: a = a / 3
print(a)  # Output: 5.0

# Modulus assignment
b = 12
b %= 5  # Equivalent to: b = b % 5
print(b)  # Output: 2
