# 1. Create a variable `count` and initialize it with the value `10`.
count = 10

# 2. Use the augmented assignment operator to subtract `3` from `count`.
count -= 3  # Equivalent to: count = count - 3

# 3. Multiply `count` by `4` using the augmented assignment operator.
count *= 4  # Equivalent to: count = count * 4

# 4. Divide `count` by `2` using the augmented assignment operator.
count /= 2  # Equivalent to: count = count / 2

# 5. Print the final value of `count` to the console.
print(count)  # Output: 14.0
