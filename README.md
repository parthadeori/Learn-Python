# **Learn Python** 🐍📚

🐍 Welcome to the "Learn Python" repository! This repository contains a series of interactive lessons to help you learn and practice Python programming. Each lesson is organized in a separate folder. Let's get started on your Python learning journey!

## **Instructions**

1. 📥 **Download the repository "Learn Python"** by following these steps:

   - Go to the GitHub repository page: [Learn Python Repository](https://github.com/parthadeori/learn-python).
   - Click on the "Code" button.
   - Choose "Download ZIP" to download the repository as a ZIP file.
   - Extract the downloaded ZIP file to a location on your computer.
  
2. **To clone the "Learn Python" repository**, you can follow these steps:

   - 🖥️ Open a terminal or command prompt on your computer.
   - - 💻 Use the `git clone` command followed by the repository URL to clone the repository. Replace `repository-url` with the actual URL of the "Learn Python" repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/learn-python.git
   ```
   
   - 📂 Navigate to the project directory:
     
   ```
   cd Python
   ```

   - ⏎ Press Enter to execute the command.
   - 🌐 Git will download the repository files to your local machine in the specified directory.

Once the cloning process is complete, you will have a local copy of the "Learn Python" repository on your computer. You can then proceed to open the text editor or code editor of your choice and follow the instructions provided in the `README.md` file to start learning and practicing Python.

3. 📝 **Open a text editor** like Notepad or a code editor like VS Code (recommended). If you don't have VS Code installed, you can download it from the official website: [Download Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)

4. ⚙️ If using VS Code, **install the required Python extensions** from the VS Code Marketplace by following these steps:

   - Open VS Code.
   - Go to the Extensions tab on the sidebar.
   - Search for "Python" in the search bar.
   - Choose the official Python extension by Microsoft and click on the "Install" button.

5. 📂 **Navigate to the lesson folder** you want to explore. For example, go to the "Lesson 1" folder to begin with the first lesson.

6. ✏️ **In the folder, you will find the following files**:

   - **README.md**: This file contains the lesson guide, including definitions and code examples. Read through the instructions and explanations provided to understand the concepts covered in the lesson.
   - **main.py**: This file contains the code examples used in the `README.md` file. You can refer to this file to see the actual code and how it works.
   - **practise.py**: This file contains practice questions for you to solve and practice your Python skills. Write your code solutions in this file.
   - **solution.py**: 💡If you get stuck or want to check your solutions, you can refer to the `solution.py` file. It contains the solutions for the practice questions.

7. 💾 **Save your changes** after writing your code in the `practice.py` file.

8. ▶️ **To run the code inside VS Code**, click on the "Run" menu at the top and choose "Run Without Debugging" or use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl + F5`. You can also run the code in a terminal by navigating to the folder and running the `python practice.py` command.

9. 🎉 You should see the output of your program displayed in the integrated terminal or output panel of VS Code.

<!-- ## **Code Playground**

For an interactive experience and to see the actual code in action, you can visit the code playground for each lesson. The code playground links are provided in the `README.md` file of each lesson folder.

Feel free to explore the code playgrounds to further enhance your understanding of Python concepts. -->

## **Folder Structure**

The repository contains the following folder structure:

```css
├── Lesson 001
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── main.py
│   ├── practice.py
│   └── solution.py
├── Lesson 002
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── main.py
│   ├── practice.py
│   └── solution.py
├── Lesson 003
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── main.py
│   ├── practice.py
│   └── solution.py
└── ...
```

Each lesson folder includes a `README.md` file with the lesson guide, a `main.py` file with the code examples, a `practice.py` file for practice questions, and a `solution.py` file with the solutions.
