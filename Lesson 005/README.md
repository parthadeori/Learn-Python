# **Lesson 5: Arithmetic Operators in Python**

üî¢ Welcome to the "Arithmetic Operators in Python" lesson! In this lesson, we'll explore various arithmetic operators available in Python to perform mathematical operations on numbers. Let's dive in!

## **Addition (+)**
The addition operator (`+`) is used to add two or more numbers together. Here's an example:

```python
x = 5
y = 3

result = x + y
print(result)  # Output: 8
```

In the above example, `x + y` adds the values of `x` and `y` together, resulting in 8.

## **Subtraction (-)**
The subtraction operator (`-`) is used to subtract one number from another. Here's an example:

```python
x = 5
y = 3

result = x - y
print(result)  # Output: 2
```

In the above example, `x - y` subtracts the value of `y` from `x`, resulting in 2.

## **Multiplication (*)**
The multiplication operator (`*`) is used to multiply two or more numbers together. Here's an example:

```python
x = 5
y = 3

result = x * y
print(result)  # Output: 15
```

In the above example, `x * y` multiplies the values of `x` and `y` together, resulting in 15.

## **Division (/)**
The division operator (`/`) is used to divide one number by another. Here's an example:

```python
x = 10
y = 3

result = x / y
print(result)  # Output: 3.3333333333333335
```

In the above example, `x / y` divides the value of `x` by `y`, resulting in approximately 3.3333333333333335. Note that the result is a floating-point number.

## **Floor Division (//)**
The floor division operator (`//`) performs division and rounds the result down to the nearest whole number. It returns the quotient without the remainder. Here's an example:

```python
x = 10
y = 3

result = x // y
print(result)  # Output: 3
```

In the above example, `x // y` performs the division of `x` by `y` and returns the whole number quotient, which is 3.

## **Modulo (%)**
The modulo operator (`%`) returns the remainder of a division operation. Here's an example:

```python
x = 10
y = 3

result = x % y
print(result)  # Output: 1
```

In the above example, `x % y` returns the remainder of dividing `x` by `y`, which is 1.

## **Practice**

Now it's time to practice using arithmetic operators in Python! Open the `practice.py` file in this folder and solve the following exercises:

1. Calculate the result of `5 + 3 * 2` and store it in a variable called `result1`. Print the value of `result1` to the console.
2. Calculate the result of `(10 - 4) / 2` and store it in a variable called `result2`. Print the value of `result2` to the console.
3. Calculate the result of `9 // 2` and store it in a variable called `result3`. Print the value of `result3` to the console.
4. Calculate the remainder of dividing `15` by `4` and store it in a variable called `remainder`. Print the value of `remainder` to the console.

Expected Outputs:

1. Calculate the result of `5 + 3 * 2` and store it in a variable called `result1`. Print the value of `result1` to the console.
   Expected output:
   ```
   11
   ```

2. Calculate the result of `(10 - 4) / 2` and store it in a variable called `result2`. Print the value of `result2` to the console.
   Expected output:
   ```
   3.0
   ```

3. Calculate the result of `9 // 2` and store it in a variable called `result3`. Print the value of `result3` to the console.
   Expected output:
   ```
   4
   ```

4. Calculate the remainder of dividing `15` by `4` and store it in a variable called `remainder`. Print the value of `remainder` to the console.
   Expected output:
   ```
   3
   ```

Make sure to run your code and compare the output with the expected output to check if your solutions are correct. Happy practicing! üöÄüêç

Once you have solved the exercises, you can check the `solution.py` file to compare your answers.
