# **Lesson 10: Statements vs Expressions**

In this lesson, we will explore the concepts of statements and expressions in Python and understand the difference between them. Let's dive in!

## **Statements**
**Statements** in Python are instructions that perform actions or tasks. They are typically used to control the flow of execution, define functions, assign values to variables, and perform I/O operations. Statements can be simple or complex, and they are executed by the Python interpreter.

**Examples of statements:**

```python
x = 5                          # Assignment statement
if condition:                  # Conditional statement
    # code block
for item in iterable:           # Loop statement
    # code block
def my_function():              # Function definition
    # code block
print("Hello, World!")          # Print statement
```

Each of these examples is a statement that carries out a specific action or task when executed.

## **Expressions**
**Expressions** in Python are combinations of values, variables, and operators that evaluate to a single value. They are used to compute and manipulate values. Expressions can be simple, such as a single variable or constant, or more complex, involving multiple operators, function calls, and operands.

Examples of expressions:

```python
3 + 4 * 2                      # Arithmetic expression
len("Hello")                   # Function call
x                              # Variable access
x > 10                         # Comparison expression
```

Expressions are evaluated to produce a value, which can then be used in statements or other expressions.

## **Difference between Statements and Expressions**
The key difference between statements and expressions is that statements are executed by the Python interpreter to perform actions, while expressions are evaluated to produce values.

- Statements perform actions or tasks, such as assigning values, controlling program flow, or defining functions. They don't produce a value that can be used further in expressions.
- Expressions, on the other hand, produce a value that can be used in statements or other expressions. They are evaluated to compute a result.

It's important to note that not all expressions can stand alone as statements. They need to be used within a larger context, such as assigning their value to a variable or using them as part of a larger expression or statement.

Understanding the distinction between statements and expressions is crucial for writing effective Python code and controlling program flow.
