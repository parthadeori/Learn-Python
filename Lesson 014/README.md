# **Lesson 14: Escape Sequences**

In Python, escape sequences are special characters that are used to represent certain non-printable or special characters within strings. They are represented by a backslash (`\`) followed by a specific character or code. Escape sequences are useful for representing characters that have a special meaning, such as newline, tab, or quotation marks, within a string.

Here are some commonly used escape sequences in Python:

- `new_line:` - Newline: Inserts a new line.
- `tab:` - Tab: Inserts a tab.
- `backslash:` - Backslash: Inserts a literal backslash.
- `double_quote:` - Double Quote: Inserts a double quote.
- `single_quote:` - Single Quote: Inserts a single quote.

Let's see some examples of how escape sequences are used in Python:

```python
# Example 1: Newline
print("Hello\nWorld")

# Output:
# Hello
# World

# Example 2: Tab
print("Name:\tJohn")

# Output:
# Name:    John

# Example 3: Backslash
print("Path: C:\\Users\\John")

# Output:
# Path: C:\Users\John

# Example 4: Double Quote
print("He said, \"Hello!\"")

# Output:
# He said, "Hello!"

# Example 5: Single Quote
print('She\'s happy.')

# Output:
# She's happy.
```

These escape sequences allow us to include special characters within strings and control the formatting of our output. Experiment with different escape sequences to achieve the desired results in your Python programs.

## **Practice Exercise**

Now it's time to practice using escape sequences! Complete the following exercise:

1. Write a Python program that prints the following pattern:

```
Hello
    World!
How are you?
```

Your program should use escape sequences to produce the exact pattern shown above. Remember to include the necessary escape sequences to create a newline and a tab.

## **Next Steps**

Now that you have learned about escape sequences, you can explore more about string manipulation in Python. Here are some suggested topics to continue your learning:

- String methods: Learn about the various built-in methods available for manipulating and formatting strings in Python, such as `lower()`, `upper()`, `strip()`, `replace()`, and more.
- String formatting: Discover different ways to format strings in Python using techniques like f-strings, format() method, and the % operator.
- Regular expressions: Explore the power of regular expressions for pattern matching and manipulating strings in Python.

Keep practicing and experimenting with strings to enhance your Python programming skills!
