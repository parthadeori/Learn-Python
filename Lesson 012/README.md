## **Lesson 12: Strings**

In Python, a string is a sequence of characters enclosed in either single quotes (`'`) or double quotes (`"`). Strings are one of the most commonly used data types in Python and are used to represent textual data.

### **Creating Strings**

You can create a string by assigning a sequence of characters to a variable. Here's an example:

```python
message = "Hello, World!"
```

In the example above, we create a string variable called `message` and assign it the value `"Hello, World!"`. The string is enclosed in double quotes.

### **String Operations**

Strings in Python support various operations, such as concatenation, slicing, and length calculation.

#### **Concatenation**

Concatenation allows you to combine two or more strings together. In Python, you can use the `+` operator to concatenate strings. Here's an example:

```python
greeting = "Hello"
name = "Alice"
message = greeting + " " + name
print(message)  # Output: Hello Alice
```

In the example above, we concatenate the strings `"Hello"`, `" "`, and `"Alice"` using the `+` operator, and assign the result to the variable `message`. The final output is `"Hello Alice"`.

#### **Slicing**

Slicing allows you to extract a portion of a string. You can specify the start and end indices to define the slice. Here's an example:

```python
text = "Hello, World!"
substring = text[7:12]
print(substring)  # Output: World
```

In the example above, we use slicing to extract the substring `"World"` from the original string `"Hello, World!"`. The indices `7:12` specify that we want to include characters from index `7` up to, but not including, index `12`.

#### **Length Calculation**

To determine the length of a string, you can use the `len()` function. Here's an example:

```python
message = "Hello, World!"
length = len(message)
print(length)  # Output: 13
```

In the example above, we use the `len()` function to calculate the length of the string `"Hello, World!"`. The result is `13`, as there are 13 characters in the string.

### **String Methods**

Python provides various built-in methods for manipulating strings. Here are some commonly used string methods:

- `lower()`: Converts all characters in the string to lowercase.
- `upper()`: Converts all characters in the string to uppercase.
- `strip()`: Removes leading and trailing whitespace from the string.
- `replace(old, new)`: Replaces occurrences of the `old` substring with the `new` substring.
- `split(separator)`: Splits the string into a list of substrings based on the specified `separator`.

Here's an example that demonstrates the usage of these string methods:

```python
text = "   Hello, World!   "
print(text.lower())         # Output:    hello, world!   
print(text.upper())         # Output:    HELLO, WORLD!   
print(text.strip())         # Output: Hello, World!
print(text.replace(" ", ""))  # Output: Hello,World!
print(text.split(","))      # Output: ['   Hello', ' World!   ']
```

In the example above, we apply different string methods to the `text` string and observe the resulting output.

### **String Formatting**

String formatting allows you to create dynamic strings by substituting values into placeholders within a string. In Python, you can use the `.format()` method or f-strings (formatted string literals) to achieve this.

Here's an example using `.format()`:

```python
name = "Alice"
age = 25
message = "My name is {} and I am {} years old.".format(name, age)
print(message)  # Output: My name is Alice and I am 25 years old.
```

In the example above, the placeholders `{}` within the string are replaced with the values of `name` and `age` using the `.format()` method.

## **Practice Exercise: Strings**

1. Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter their first name and last name as separate inputs. Then, concatenate the first name and last name to form a full name. Finally, print the full name to the console.

2. Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter a sentence. Then, count the number of characters in the sentence (excluding whitespace) and print the result to the console.

<!-- 3. Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter a word. Then, check if the word is a palindrome (i.e., it reads the same forwards and backwards). Print "Palindrome" if it is a palindrome, and "Not a palindrome" otherwise. -->

<!-- 4. Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter a sentence. Then, capitalize the first letter of each word in the sentence and print the modified sentence to the console. -->

<!-- 5. Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter a sentence. Then, replace all occurrences of a specified word in the sentence with another word provided by the user. Print the modified sentence to the console. -->
