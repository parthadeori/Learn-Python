# Lesson 4: Numbers in Python

üî¢ Welcome to the "Lesson 4: Numbers in Python" lesson! In this lesson, we'll explore the different types of numbers in Python and how to work with them. Python provides several built-in numeric types, including integers, floating-point numbers, and complex numbers. Let's dive in!

## **Integers**

Integers are whole numbers without any fractional part. In Python, you can define integers by assigning a numerical value without a decimal point. For example:

```python
x = 10
y = -5
```

In the above example, we defined two integers: `x` with a value of 10 and `y` with a value of -5. Integers can be positive or negative.

## **Floating-Point Numbers**

Floating-point numbers, or simply floats, are numbers that have a fractional part. They are represented using a decimal point. For example:

```python
pi = 3.14
radius = 2.5
```

In the above example, we defined two floating-point numbers: `pi` with a value of 3.14 and `radius` with a value of 2.5.

## **Numeric Operations**

Python provides various arithmetic operations that can be performed on numbers. Here are some commonly used operations:

### **Addition**

```python
x = 5 + 3
```

The `+` operator is used to perform addition. In the example above, we add 5 and 3, and the result is assigned to the variable `x`.

### **Subtraction**

```python
y = 10 - 7
```

The `-` operator is used to perform subtraction. In the example above, we subtract 7 from 10, and the result is assigned to the variable `y`.

### **Multiplication**

```python
z = 4 * 6
```

The `*` operator is used to perform multiplication. In the example above, we multiply 4 and 6, and the result is assigned to the variable `z`.

### **Division**

```python
w = 15 / 3
```

The `/` operator is used to perform division. In the example above, we divide 15 by 3, and the result is assigned to the variable `w`. Note that in Python 3.x, division always returns a float.

## **Complex Numbers**

Complex numbers consist of a real part and an imaginary part. They are represented using the `j` or `J` suffix. For example:

```python
c = 2 + 3j
```

In the above example, we defined a complex number `c` with a real part of 2 and an imaginary part of 3.

## **Type Conversion**

Sometimes, you may need to convert one numeric type to another. Python provides built-in functions for type conversion, such as `int()`, `float()`, and `complex()`. Here are some examples:

```python
x = 10
y = float(x)  # Convert x to a float
z = complex(x)  # Convert x to a complex number
```

In the above example, we converted the integer `x` to a float and a complex number using the `float()` and `complex()` functions, respectively.

## **Practice Exercise**

Now, let's move on to the next step! Open the `practice.py` file and solve the given question.

**Question:** Write a Python program to calculate the area of a rectangle. Prompt the user to enter the length and width of the rectangle, then calculate and display the area.

Expected Output:
```
Enter the length of the rectangle: 5
Enter the width of the rectangle: 3
The area of the rectangle is: 15.0
```

Once you've completed the exercise, run the code and verify if it produces the expected output.

üöÄ Great job! You've learned about different Number data types in Python and some Arithmetic Operations.
